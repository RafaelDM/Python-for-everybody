10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure 
out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages.
You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then 
splitting the string a second time using a colon.

From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.
Output
04 3
06 1
07 1
09 2
10 3
11 6
14 1
15 2
16 4
17 2
18 1
19 1
