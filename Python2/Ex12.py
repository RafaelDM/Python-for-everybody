9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent 
the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes 
the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates 
a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of 
times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through 
the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.
